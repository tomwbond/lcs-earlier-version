# Boilerplate post

![Mixed use residential area](/images/mixed-use-residential.jpg)

In Cities: Skylines, money isn’t too hard to make. Once the city reaches a few tens of thousands - assuming it’s relatively well-managed - you’ll probably be sitting on a few million in the bank and have enough to build pretty much whatever you need.

## Put up your taxes straight away

As soon as you unlock the taxes panel in the UI, head in there and put them up to 12%. Your residents will happily pay that much without complaining, even without better services. That’s a full third more income right out the gate, which makes a big difference. Don’t forget to head in there again when you unlock high density zoning and offices.

*Thanks for reading! I hope you found these ideas handy. If there’s anything really good I missed out,* [*let me know*](/about.md)*. I’d be glad to add it.*
