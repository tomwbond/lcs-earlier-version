## Match Day policies


The free Match Day DLC is available as soon as you install the game. It unlocks a huge football stadium with a minigame attached. In the run-up to each scheduled match, hundreds of citizens begin arriving. The closer you get to 750 entrants, the more likely your team is to win. An efficient public transport network is the most effective way to improve your chances, but these policies also contribute.

## Concerts policies


A small paid-for DLC, Concerts follows in Match Day’s footsteps and adds an attendance-based minigame. The more people attend, the more successful the concert. The system is deeper here, though. There’s several buildings that contribute to each band’s popularity. Hit certain milestones and the concert ground can be upgraded. Optional policies help to accelerate progress - for a price.
